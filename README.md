Good morning/afternoon.

My name is Jeba Shaikh. I have around 6 years of experience as a Java Full Stack Developer and am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Virtusa in the telecom domain.

I primarily work with Java and Spring Boot on the backend, where I develop REST APIs and microservices-based applications. I have experience handling high-volume telecom data and focus on building secure and efficient systems.

On the frontend, I use Angular to create responsive and user-friendly applications, ensuring smooth integration with backend services.

In my current role, I am involved in the complete development lifecycle — from understanding requirements and participating in design discussions to deployment and production support. I also take responsibility for key modules, contribute to code reviews, and support team members whenever needed.

I have worked in Agile environments and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver quality solutions on time.

Outside of work, I enjoy learning about new technologies, reading self-development content, and listening to music. I believe continuous learning is important for both personal and professional growth.

I am now looking for an opportunity where I can continue to grow, contribute meaningfully to the team, and work on scalable enterprise applications.
